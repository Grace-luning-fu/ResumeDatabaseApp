@author Grace, Aug 6, 2017


This Web App allows user to:
1. Add resume (with validation for name, email, startdate and enddate) to a database hosted on Mysql;
2. Calucate employed days (for both current jobs and past jobs);
3. Display added entries/results with calculated employed days;
4. Display a list of all resumes in the database (also display calculated employed days)


*Needs to work on @Past validate "LocalDate" date type(since Hibernate does not support LocalDate type)

reference: 
Display dates in the validated format in HTML using thymeleaf:
